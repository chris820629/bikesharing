# Bike Sharing

This project focused on the application of Python Pandas and Tableau, and how we leveraged their useful functions and GUIs for performing in-depth data analytics and visualizations.

## Overview and Objective of Project

This project and Module 15 assignment focused on cultivating knowledge and skills of data analytics and visualizations that helped to further understand the concepts of crafting convincing analysis report and bike sharing business proposal. During the completion of this project we mainly leveraged the powerful features offered by Python Pandas and [Tableau Public](https://www.tableau.com/products/public), a free platform that lets us explore, create, and publicly share data visualizations online.

### Challenge Overview

Below is the outline of our deliverables and a written report for presenting our results and analysis summary. Upon completion of this project, we created visualizations that showed the length of time that bikes were checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. We then compiled a final presentation that summarizes our analysis results and data visualizations for our stakeholders and potential investors.

### Technology


## Experimental and Analysis Results

We first reformatted the original csv data by using Python Pandas and then used Tableau to perform in-depth analysis and visualizations. Although I retained all the initial field data when saving the modified DataFrame to a csv file, there were several unique approaches that I used when accomplishing the required visualizations as discussed and highlighted below. Some of the improvement ideas for future analysis were also analyzed and embodied in the Tableau visualization dashboard (<a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/s.tandjoeng/viz/bikesharing_visualizations_16701338840620/NYCCitiBikeSharingAnalysis" target="_blank" title="Link to NYC Citi Bike Analysis">Tableau Bike Sharing Visualizations</a>).

### Discovery 1
Most rides are around 10 minutes, showing users may be using them as secondary transportation from office to metro stations. Further investigation could focus on the customer id on their start and end destionations for customer behavior study.

### Discovery 4
Most common hours are 7/8am and 5/6pm on weekdays. Weekend usage is more evenly distributed throughout 10am to 5pm. Thurs and Fri occasionally have customers between 1 and 5pm as well.
